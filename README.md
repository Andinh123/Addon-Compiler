# Addon-Compiler from BlockState.Team (Made by Blues)

This simple compiler requires NodeJS to work properly!
For people who don't know how code works, you can download the VBS script and run it: [CLICK ME](https://blockstate.team/projects/Add-On%20Compiler%20Download.vbs)


For dev, download this repo, and run "npm i" then "node app" to launch the compiler UI
