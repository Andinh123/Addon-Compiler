# Addon-Compiler from BlockState.Team (Made by Blues)

This simple compiler requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to work properly!
For people who don't know how code works, you can download the VBS script and run it: [CLICK ME](https://blockstate.team/projects/Add-On%20Compiler%20Download.vbs)


For dev, download this repo, and run "npm i" then "node app" to launch the compiler UI
 
If you want to add your own UI (through CSS), go to "C:\Addon-Compiler-main\public", create a "user.css", the program should now be able to use it as an UI
